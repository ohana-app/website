# Why Use Us? 

**Why pay more for the same thing? Ohana offers the same functionality offered with paid services and packages it with an open source platform, allowing your team to customize and scale to your company's needs.**

- Flexibility: Because we are open source, additional functionality beyond user management, cluster creation, and deployment is ultimately decided by your specific needs
- Bloat: We offer the bare-bones essentials to create, scale, and deploy with simple clicks. Onboarding new or existing employees has never been easier
- Simplicity: Our UI is simple, intuitive, and abstracts the difficulties of learning the Kubernetes platforms to get your developer teams running quicker - faster
